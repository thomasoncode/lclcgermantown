      <description>Over the past few years, some of us have been gathering together in the fall to make fleece blankets (NO SEWING REQUIRED) to give to area individuals and families in need of something to help keep them warm in the upcoming colder weather. Although any size is OK, we have made blankets in the past that are about 2 and half yards long. Due to additional responsibilities for Pastor Spies in serving two congregations, we do not have any selected evenings scheduled for group blanket making this year.</description>
