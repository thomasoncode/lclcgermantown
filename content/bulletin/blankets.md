Over the past few years, some of us have been
gathering together in the fall to make fleece
blankets (NO SEWING REQUIRED) to give to
area individuals and families in need of something
to help keep them warm in the upcoming colder
weather. Although any size is OK, we have made
blankets in the past that are about 2 and half yards
long. Due to additional responsibilities for Pastor
Spies in serving two congregations, we do not have
any selected evenings scheduled for group blanket
making this year. However, Pastor Spies has
already purchased or received more than enough
fabric to make at least ten blankets, and we could
use your help in putting these blankets together.
This could mean service hours for youth in need of
such hours for school organizations. This could be
an activity for a group of people in the
congregation. Or this could be something that
individuals within the congregation would like to do
while at home knowing that they will be going to
someone in need. Please see Pastor Spies if
you would like to help. He would be
happy to get you the fabric and give you
instructions for making the blankets.
Our goals would be to complete at
least ten before Christmas this year.
